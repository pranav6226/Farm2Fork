## Executive Summary
Farm2Fork is a comprehensive supply chain application developed using Microsoft PowerApps, SQL database, and PowerBI. This platform seamlessly connects farmers, distributors, and consumers, providing real-time analytics on stock levels, profit and loss, and overall supply chain efficiency. By integrating data analytics through PowerBI, Farm2Fork enhances decision-making, fosters transparency, and supports a more connected agricultural ecosystem.

## Business Problem
The agricultural supply chain is often plagued by inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and disconnected stakeholders. Farmers, distributors, and consumers struggle with limited access to real-time data, leading to suboptimal decision-making and potential losses. Farm2Fork aims to address these challenges by providing a unified platform that streamlines the supply chain, offers real-time insights, and fosters better collaboration among all stakeholders.

## Methodology

### Application Development
1. **Microsoft PowerApps:** The application was built using Microsoft PowerApps, providing an intuitive interface for farmers, distributors, and consumers to interact with the platform. Each stakeholder can access relevant data and perform necessary actions directly from the app.
2. **SQL Database:** The backend of Farm2Fork is powered by a SQL database, which stores all relevant data related to the supply chain, including inventory levels, transactions, and financial metrics. The database was designed to support efficient data retrieval and ensure data integrity across the platform.
   - **Data Insertion:** Custom SQL scripts were developed to manage the insertion of farmer inventories and other critical data into the database.
   - **Stored Procedures:** Several stored procedures were created to handle complex business logic, including inventory updates, profit and loss calculations, and other automated processes.
   - **Database Maintenance:** SQL scripts were also developed to manage database maintenance tasks, such as backups and updates, ensuring the system remains robust and reliable.
3. **Python for Data Generation:** Python scripts were employed to generate synthetic data for testing purposes, simulating real-world scenarios and ensuring the platform's functionality before deployment.

### Data Analytics
1. **PowerBI Integration:** PowerBI was integrated into the Farm2Fork application to provide real-time analytics and reporting. This includes dashboards for tracking stock levels, financial performance, and other key metrics.
2. **Excel for Data Analysis:** Detailed data analysis was conducted using Excel, with various sheets dedicated to different aspects of the supply chain. This analysis informed the development of PowerBI reports and helped identify key trends and insights.
